# Modeling Mental Health

‚û°Ô∏è For modelling, the Poisson Regression model has been used, relying on its flexibility to perform interpretations and statistical inference, and taking into account that the main variable to be analysed (response) is a count variable, specifically, the number of days with poor mental health in the last 30 days.

üîª Objectives

   - The basic objective is to analyse how a series of variables (predictors) influence people's (self-perception) of mental health. As well as to determine which are the most relevant to predict/explain this variable.
